# BraTS
In the project, we integrated the techniques of Fermi normalization and fast data density functional transform (fDDFT), and established a new global convolutional self-action module to reduce the computational complexity in modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Moreover, we applied the dimension-fusion U-Net as a backbone and utilized the datasets from BraTS 2020.
